# Get Reps Selling the Right Products

  1. Your reps track the products they sell to customers using product records. Products include details, such as the product’s:

    * Name

    * Code 
    
    * Description

    * Indication of whether it's active 

  2. Each of those products has a standard price. When you create products in Salesforce, you add a standard price to each one.

  3. Then those products appear in the standard price book, accessible from each product or from the App Launcher.

  4. Sometimes, though, you want to track a product that has more than one price. That’s when you create multiple price books.

    * Say, for example, you sell coffee grinders at different prices depending on whether you’re selling to domestic or nondomestic customers.

# Track Multiple Prices for the Same Product

  1. From the App Launcher, Maria selects Price Books.

  2. To create a price book, Maria clicks New, and then adds the specifics.

  3. On the Related tab, she clicks Add Product, selects one of the products and a currency, and clicks Next.

  4. Here’s where Maria adds the list price specific to this new price book. See how it’s lower than the standard price of $100,000? That discounted price offsets the tax incentive not offered to West Coast customers.

# How Sales Reps Sell Products in Salesforce

  1. Maria’s sales reps are ready to sell to their West Coast customers. One of the newer sales reps, Lance, works an opportunity in the Qualification stage. He called Ritu, a key decision maker at Dickenson PLC.

# Add a Product to an Opportunity

  1. From the Products related list on the opportunity that Lance is working, he selects Add Product.

  2. He then chooses the price book West Coast Manufacturing, and adds the product GenWatt Diesel 1000kW and sets the quantity to 1. In that price book, the product price reflects the discount Ursa Major offers.

  3. Lance confirms the product appears as he expects—with the discounted price.

# Quotes Basics

  1. As your sales reps work their deals, they prepare quotes for customers. Quotes show your customers the prices of the products and services your company offers.

  2. Your reps have the flexibility to create a set of quotes that show different combinations of products, discounts, and quantities. 

# Enable Quotes

  1. From Setup, Maria enters Quote in the Quick Find box, then selects Quotes Settings.

  2. She then selects Enable.

  3. Our sales rep, Lance, continues to work an opportunity. He set the opportunity’s stage to Proposal/Price Quote. 
  
    * So now he’s ready to get a quote to his customer at Dickenson PLC. Let’s look at how he prepares the quote.

# Create a Quote

  1. From Setup, Maria enters Quote in the Quick Find box, then selects Quotes Settings.

  2. She then selects Enable.

  3. Lance saves his work, and then the new quote appears.

    * At this point, he selects the quote, and he sees that the product from the opportunity appears as a line item. 
    
    * Lance can add other products as line items if he wants to.

  4. Lance plans to send multiple quotes to his customer. After he and his customer agree on a specific quote, 

    * Lance is ready to sync the quote. When he syncs the quote, its line items appear as the opportunity’s products. 
    
    * That way, Lance isn’t at risk of having discrepancies between the line items in his quote and the products in his opportunity.

# Prepare Quotes for Delivery to Customers

# Create a Quote Template

  1. From Setup, Maria enters Templates in the Quick Find box, then selects Quote Templates.

  2. Maria creates a template. Then, she gives it a name and saves it.

  3. Maria then scrolls to the Totals section and removes the Tax field.

  4. Then she saves her work. Maria’s ready to release the template to her reps, so she activates it.

# Contracts Basics

# Set Up Contracts to Appear on Opportunity Details

  1. From Setup, Maria clicks Object Manager at the top of the page. She selects the Opportunity object, and clicks Contract in the fields area. 
  
    * Then, she clicks Set Field-Level Security.

  2. She selects Visible for each profile that she wants the Contracts related list to appear on, and then saves her changes.

  3. Maria clicks View Field Accessibility.

  4. For one of the profiles that Maria wants contracts available, she clicks Hidden.

  5. Maria selects Visible under Page Layout.

  6. Then she saves her changes. Profiles are now marked Editable.

  7. To verify that her changes took effect, Maria creates an opportunity and adds a contract to it.

  8. After she saves the new opportunity, she sees the contract related to it in opportunity details.

# How Sales Reps Create Contracts and Relate Them to Opportunities

  1. Create a Contract

  2. Lance enters details specific to this contract. Then, he saves his work.

  3. Relate a Contract to an Opportunity

    * Lance opens an opportunity for Dickenson PLC that he wants to relate to a contract.

    * He clicks Details.

    * Then, Lance selects a contract from a list that’s specific to the Dickenson PLC account.

    * He saves his work, and sees the contract related to his opportunity.
