# Track a Deal with Path

  1. Path is a simple tool with some powerful features. 

    * Path shows you at a glance where the record is in your sales process. It’s a quick indicator that helps you visualize where you are and where you’re going.

    * Key Fields highlight the information you need the most when you open a record, so you don’t have to switch tabs or scroll around to find critical data.

    * Use the Path to update the record’s status by clicking Mark Status as Complete to move the record to the next step on the path

    *  It’s easy to select a different status if your deal loses steam and you need to retreat back to a previous status, or moves so fast you need to skip ahead. Click the step on the path you’re moving to, then click Mark Current Status.
  
# Manage Records in the Kanban View

  1. The Kanban view is a visual summary of the records in a list view. It gives you a big picture view of all your work and lets you easily sort, summarize, filter, and move your opportunities along your pipeline. 

  2. Let’s check out the Kanban view for opportunitie

    * Select the Opportunities tab.

    * Select the All Opportunities list view.

    * From the Display As menu (Display As menu icon), select Kanban.

    * Here’s how easy it is to move an opportunity to the next stage in this view.

      - Click any deal in the column on the left.

      - While holding down the mouse, drag the deal’s card into a different column.

      - Release the mouse button.

# Take Action on Your Records

  1. If you need to make other changes, you can do that, too. Just click the down arrow on a Kanban card, and select Edit (1). Make whatever change you need in the record right within the Kanban view.

    * If an opportunity doesn’t have any upcoming tasks or events, the Kanban card shows a warning symbol (2) to let you know that you might need to set an activity so your deal doesn’t stall out.

# View a Chart

  1. Click Show charts (1) and you see a chart or graph that summarizes the data in your list view in different ways.

  2. For example, if you select Pipeline by Account, you can quickly see which account you’ve done the most business with. Or, select Pipeline by Stage to discover in a glance which stages your deals are in.

  3. Want to see your Pipeline by Stage chart as a bar chart instead of a donut chart? Click Settings (2) and select a different type of chart.

  4. When you’re done reviewing your charts, click the right arrow (3) to close the Chart sidebar, or click Show charts (1) again

  5. Whatever options you use to filter your records, don’t forget to disable the filter when you’re done. To disable the filter, click Remove All, then click Save.

# Change Up the Kanban View

  1. By default, the Kanban view for opportunities organizes your records into columns by Stage, and shows a summary of the deals in each column based on the sum of the Amounts of each column’s opportunities

  2. Click List View Controls (List View Controls icon) and select Kanban Settings.

  3. Change Summarize By to Expected Revenue.

    * You could click the down arrow and select Edit to view the full record and update the Type field. But if that’s all you need to change, you can update the records’ Type more quickly by dragging them to a new Type column.
