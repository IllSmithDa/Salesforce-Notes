# A Platform Approach to Recurring Business and Better Relationships 

  1. When you think about where Salesforce Billing is in that process, you first drill down into the Sales Cloud. It’s where you manage sales data, leads, and opportunities, all the way to the configure, price, and quote (CPQ) process with Salesforce CPQ.

  2. At the tail end of that, your business would generate contracts and orders, setting up the foundation for billing your customer–and that’s where Salesforce Billing sits, as an add-on to Salesforce CPQ. 

  3. Recurring Business/Recurring Revenue 

    * Many companies are moving to a recurring business model. 

      - This means there’s a healthy appetite to add services or subscriptions to what they offer. 

      - Think of a manufacturing company also selling warranties, or a software company offering subscriptions.

  4. True Cross-Team Collaboration.

    * When you’re on a single platform, working off of a single toolset, you have the ability to work more closely with teams that may have been siloed in the past.

    * Think about introducing a new product or subscription. It’s more than just adding a line item to an order. There’s a whole process from selling to billing that you have to think through and then execute. This is the promise of our platform.

# Billing Is More Than Just Billing 

  1. There are more things in the customer lifecycle that affect invoicing, payment, and reporting on revenue than just the tools you use. 

  2. In order to be an effective financial controller for your company, you have to consider the revenue lifecycle. And guess what? It starts with Sales. This is why we’ve designed Salesforce Billing to be an add-on to Salesforce CPQ.

  3. The opportunity, quote, and contract stages—all managed by Sales. In the past, Finance wouldn’t need to worry too much about them–there’s nothing to report on, let alone to process. 

  4.  But what happens at these stages impacts the billing process more than one would think.

    * Consider several scenarios.

      - Your Sales teams work offline—spreadsheets, emails, paper contracts, and so on. Do you find your organization having to track down critical data or needing to go through multiple reviews before starting the billing process?

      - Reconciling add-ons and upgrades is an arduous process, as you have to consider what has already been billed, delivered, and reported on. Then you have to calculate or even recalculate proration. And the Sales team keeps on selling.

      - Introducing new products or business models is long and painful. Is there a disconnect or long ramp time when a new product gets sold? Does the thought of pivoting to hybrid or recurring revenue give you pause?

      - You need to know more about the customer, but there isn’t much to go on. Purchasing data is incomplete. It’s hard to determine if service was delivered on time.

    * More can be added here, but the key concept should be clear—Finance, Sales, and Sales Operations are interdependent. How deals are closed, what data is captured, and how fast you can adapt to change all determine how well you can do your job. And much of this complexity is managed by Salesforce CPQ.

    * Does bookings, billings, and cash sound like familiar territory? This is where Finance starts getting down to business, especially around invoices. And, if the quote is done right, if the contract and order have the right prorated amounts, and the right credits and discounts are applied, billing goes off without a hitch. You can get the invoice out quickly; customers experience a reliable post-sales process;

    * By now, you may be getting the sense that our point of view on billing is focused on the relationship between Sales and Finance, as well as the relationship you have with your customers.

    * But when you focus on relationships (asking questions such as, “How can Sales and Finance work better together?” or “How do we put the customer at the center of everything we do?”) and a technology platform that helps you transform, you strive to turn customers into advocates and earn repeat business.

# Salesforce Billing: Making Sense of Chaos 

  1. The absolute of numbers is arguably why billing is so appealing to the layperson. A customer owes you a specific amount of money on a specific date. You bill them. You get money back. You add up the numbers and that’s your revenue.

    * But we know there’s more to it than that. And as we mentioned in the previous unit, a lot of the complexity happens well before billing tools comes into play.

# Finance’s Seat at the Table 

  1. It’s important to understand that even though it’s used by Sales, Salesforce CPQ really is the first stop for the Finance team, which is partly why Salesforce Billing is an add-on as opposed to a stand-alone or siloed system. 

  2. Salesforce CPQ generates the contract, where the terms and commitments influence the way you recognize revenue. (What are our obligations and did we deliver on them in time?) 

    * It’s also where the order originates, which is key to tracking bookings and generating the invoice. 

    * Ultimately, it’s important to get these right so that Salesforce Billing can take this information and continue the process in a seamless manner through invoice to accounts receivable.

  3. First, let’s discuss the opportunities this type of platform offers.

    * True automation can be achieved, since data can easily flow through quotes, contracts, and orders into invoicing. There is no need for recalculation, no need to reconcile differences between systems, and you can be as hands-free or as hands-on as you wish. 

    * The Sales-to-Finance gap is virtually eliminated. When you think about introducing a new product or business model, or changes to processes, both teams can quickly adapt since you are on the same platform working with the same toolset—closer knit by design. 

# Time Is on Your Side 

  1. Another key feature of Salesforce Billing is how we treat time. Where Salesforce CPQ enables such things as ramps, order splitting, and amendments for the delivery of services across a period of time, we bring it around full circle with Salesforce Billing. 

    * Align Billing Dates Across Amendments

      - Amendments are important to recurring business, as customers have the flexibility to add on or upgrade in the middle of the billing cycle. 
      
      - This feature allows you to align the billing dates across these changes—useful if you want to send out only one invoice that recognizes what can be multiple changes to an order. 

    * Override Billing Dates

      - Temporarily change important billing dates. This helps you control the timing and duration of invoice generation for your customers. 

    * Hold Billing

      - Prevent an order from billing until it meets certain criteria. 

    * Proration 

      - For changes to a contract during a contract term, automatically pull proration from the quoting and contract process to generate coterminus renewals.

      - The customer sees what it costs to upgrade, downgrade, or swap in the quote (Salesforce CPQ) and Salesforce Billing generates an invoice with the exact same data automatically. No manual entry or recalculation! 

  2. Salesforce has powerful features to give you full control of time with billing. The next challenge is how much should be billed?
    
    * This is where the power of having Salesforce CPQ and Billing together really shines. 
      
    * Since Salesforce CPQ manages the subscription and amendments, you can see the exact amount that will be billed early in the quoting process for both new orders and orders generated from contract amendments.

  3. In the end, all of these features are about giving your customers flexibility to do business with you, adding to that business on their schedule, and making sure they get what they need when they need it.

  4. Finance has the last piece of the puzzle to the customer lifecycle. What’s been sold, what’s yet to be delivered, what services are subscribed to, when a customer is up for renewal… when you’re talking to the Finance team, you know exactly when to get in contact with your customer about continuing your relationship with them.

  5. If we’re putting relationships back into focus, having the right platform for revenue is about streamlining and scaling one of the final bastions of the customer engagement in a way that cultivates loyalty, trust, and repeat business.

# Invoice Execution 

  1. One-Time Invoicing

    * The ability to manually post invoices. 

  2. Recurring Invoices

    * The ability to automate invoices that meet a specific criteria. Ideal for common, transactional interactions. 

  3. Variable Invoicing/Dynamic Invoice Plan

    * For invoicing needs that don’t follow standard billing frequencies, such as billing to milestones or project acceptance. 

# Streamlined Order-to-Invoice Conversion 

  1. In a traditional revenue lifecycle, you have Sales on one side and Finance on the other both in their siloed systems. All of the customer interaction and potential financial data moves through the sales motion and then all of a sudden, it hits a wall.

  2. You have the very real risk of inaccuracy and confused processes as you try to pass off information, reprocess data, recalculate proration and price, and so on.

  3. What happens when you try to introduce change through recurring business? Maybe you want to dabble in services. Maybe you want to fully transform how you go to market. The process breaks down.

  4. And these have been the core challenges we aim solve with our billing solution. With Salesforce CPQ and Billing, the end to end customer engagement can be managed in Salesforce whereas the internal financial system of record is managed in the ERP.

  5. When leveraging our platform, there’s one point of pricing doing the calculations, one continuous process for transaction, and then a seamless hand-off to Accounts Receivable and Reporting. 

  6. Right away, a lot of the chaos of recalculation and duplication disappears, data flows quicker between points in the revenue lifecycle, and you’re able to get down to execution.

  7. This is one way Salesforce CPQ and Salesforce Billing work with ERP. Depending on your needs, invoicing and orchestrating payments may sit better with ERP, for example.

    * The point here is that you get a unified experience—one system of engagement, seamless transaction, and Finance doesn’t have to worry about the complexities of pricing, pricing rules, and so on.

# The Different Deployment Models for Salesforce Billing 

  1. Give Finance a Helping Hand, we called out why it’s so important to maintain flexibility throughout the revenue lifecycle.

    * It benefits Sales, as they can sell the way they need to, while you still maintain the appropriate guardrails for pricing, data capture, and workflow. 

    * At the same time, it helps you maintain the appropriate balance of making your customers happy while also fulfilling your business obligations.
  
# There is another area of flexibility that our platform offers, and that’s with process. We’re not talking about workflows and data handoff here. 

  3. We’re talking about implementing the best revenue lifecycle model that makes sense for your team and your technology footprint.

    * Lead-to-Invoice

      - It solves scale challenges when launching new products, invoicing challenges with subscription, usage/metrics charges, and consumption/utility charges. Financial operations and accounting is still managed in ERP, but with cleaner data, as there is only one pricing and transaction engine. 

    * Lead-to-Cash

      - Give Finance a Helping Hand. In this model, Salesforce Billing also supports invoicing and orchestrates collections. Clean data is handed off for GL and reporting. 

# Let’s Talk About Integrations 

  1. we’ve shown you the critical areas that are streamlined by having Salesforce CPQ and Salesforce Billing on the same platform. It’s the same platform that makes integration with tax calculators, payment processors, and ERP easier.

  2. With Salesforce Billing, you have the flexibility to set up unique tax rules for each product. Declaratively (point and click) assign one or multiple rules to fire, ensuring you get taxation right. For example, you can determine:

    * Whether or not a product should be taxed in the first place
    
    * What integration should be used (more on that below)
    
    * Tax code(s)
    
    * GL rules to direct the record keeping process

  3. Whether you use a complete system that calculates taxes for invoicing and remittance filing, or you need to use a third-party calculator and then need to hand off to yet another tool (phew!), the platform can support these steps.

# Payment

  1. Native integrations with payment systems like PayPal, Authorize.net, and CyberSource, to name a few, are available for the Lead-to-Cash model. 

  2. Here, Salesforce Billing helps track and manage invoices and payments. You can declaratively set up debit or credit notes against invoices. And you can automate some or all of the processing.

  3. Key features include:

    * Process Payments - Process full or partial payments using stored payment methods against multiple invoices and at the individual line level.

    * Recurring Payments - This enables you to automate the payment process. 
    
      - Rules are set up to have Salesforce Billing evaluate invoices over time and make scheduled payments against the customer’s payment information.

    * Apply Credits and Debits

      - Issue stand-alone credit or debit notes and apply notes to individual invoice lines.

# About ERP

  1. Again, the deployment model you choose influences how you treat the integration with ERP. Luckily, once you have the process figured out, Salesforce or a Systems Integrator can help identify the right type of integration.

  2. The Salesforce Platform offers native connectors with major ERP systems and a catalog of partners who can help you figure out the best approach.

  3. These are available on the Salesforce AppExchange, our application marketplace. And if there are any custom integrations required, the system scales with you. With every automatic upgrade, we ensure our APIs are backward compatible, so that the connections you put in place don’t break.

  4. OK, let’s do a quick roll call of all the teams involved in transforming the revenue lifecycle.

    * Your customers (required)

    * Finance (most definitely)

    * Operations

    * Sales

    * Systems Integrator

    * Salesforce CPQ and Salesforce Billing

  5. When it comes to business transformation, whether it’s focused on implementing new products and services, new business models, or reevaluating your relationships, this is the ideal order of importance. In a perfect world, everything cascades from the customer and how you’re adapting to their needs.
