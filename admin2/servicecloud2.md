# Why Two-Way Mobile Messaging Is the Future of Customer Service 

  1. So let’s get into the benefits of two-way messaging.

    * The cost is lower than voice calls, reducing cost per customer interaction

    * Agents can handle multiple messages at the same time

    * Call volume is reduced. In fact, Salesforce has seen call volumes go down by 15–30%
    
    * ROI gets a boost from all the cost saving and added efficiency

    * Customer satisfaction soars with agents delivering a personalized conversational experience—fast

# Unlock the Power of Service Cloud Messaging for Customer Service 

  1. Service Cloud Messaging empowers companies to engage with customers through the messaging apps they love—all powered by Service Cloud, the world’s number one customer service platform.

  2. Service Cloud Messaging brings service to customers right where they want it most: on their mobile device using any message app. Now, agents can connect with customers on Facebook or SMS directly through the agent desktop. 

  3. And they can do it all through the existing customer care 1-800 line. Plus the agent never has to leave the agent desktop, so these interactions never leave the Salesforce environment. With Service Cloud Messaging you can:

    * Move from transactions to conversations and even speak emoji.

    * Use service chatbots for data gathering and simple FAQs, letting agents focus on more complex issues.

    * Reduce call volume, operational costs, and boost customer satisfaction.

# Deliver Seamless, Personalized On-Site Service with Field Service Lightning

# Deliver Personalized On-Site Service with Field Service Lightning 

  1. On-Site Service: A Primer on the Players 

    * The customer who makes the service request for a product that requires support

    * The agent who receives the service request and creates a work order

    * The dispatcher who ensures that the right work is assigned to the right mobile employee based on schedules, expertise, and location

    * The mobile field worker who receives the work order and actually makes the on-site visit to complete the job

  2. Meet the Mobile Worker, Your Newest Brand Ambassador 

    * While stellar field service depends on many factors, at the end of the day, you’re really measured on the quality of the individual service you provide to each and every customer.

    * The mobile worker is a vital part of the field service process. They’re usually the most closely connected to powering a positive customer experience. 

    * Their interactions with customers can make or break the experience. To ensure they’re on the right path to making customers happy, remote employees need access to work orders and other key information on the go, including real-time job updates, schedules, inventory, and customer information so that they’re always working off of the most current information.

# Turn Your Mobile Worker into a Hero 

  1. To increase first-time and fix-rate numbers, field agents must have everything they need to get the job done quickly and effectively, right from their mobile device. 

  2. Your field agents may not always have the answer to every single problem, but with the power of mobility (and even offline connectivity to records and information), these technicians can be connected to the right reports, resources, and experts from anywhere at any time.

# Get to Know Field Service Lightning

  1. With Field Service Lightning, all your call center agents, dispatchers, and mobile employees can work together on the same platform. It gives mobile employees the power to tap into job information, deliver updates, and quickly collaborate on the go, even offline. The information they need is in the palm of their hands.

# On-Site Service: A Primer on the Players 

  1. Field service is much more than just sending someone out into the field with a clipboard and a truck. 

  2. Field service management is a complex organization of work tasks that need to be performed on-site.

  3. The dispatcher who ensures that the right work is assigned to the right mobile employee based on schedules, expertise, and location

  4. The mobile field worker who receives the work order and actually makes the on-site visit to complete the job

# Meet the Mobile Worker, Your Newest Brand Ambassador

  2. Your field agents may not always have the answer to every single problem, but with the power of mobility (and even offline connectivity to records and information), these technicians can be connected to the right reports, resources, and experts from anywhere at any time.

  3. What does this mean for your business? No more scheduling a follow-up appointment with the customer due to lack of information in the field. Unfortunately, current field service technology has fallen short in fulfilling the needs of mobile workers—until now. 

# Get to Know Field Service Lightning 

  1. With Field Service Lightning, all your call center agents, dispatchers, and mobile employees can work together on the same platform.

    * It gives mobile employees the power to tap into job information, deliver updates, and quickly collaborate on the go, even offline. The information they need is in the palm of their hands.
  
  2. Scheduling: Get the right field agents where they need to be, when they need to be there. 

    * The smart scheduling feature in Field Service Lightning feature automatically optimizes scheduling, so that you can get the most out of every mobile worker’s day, and get them where they need to be on time. 

    * With skills-based routing, your agents are assigned tasks based on their particular skill set. 

    * And when they’re already on the move, dispatchers can view all scheduled appointments, see alerts for issues, and track where agents are.

    * So businesses can direct exactly where their mobile workers need to go to keep wait times down and productivity up.

  3. Work orders: Get key customer insights. 

    * With Field Service Lightning, the service agent has a full view of the customer and their needs.

    * This means they can create work orders that are mobile, connected, and fully integrated in other areas of the business and CRM, including accounts, contacts, assets, cases, entitlements, and service contracts.
 
  4. Connect: Create a virtual contact center in the field. 

    * Bring the information and power of your contact center directly to your mobile workforce right in the Field Service Lightning app, so workers can instantly view vital customer information, deliver updates, access knowledge articles, and collaborate with product experts on the go.

    * As we all know, cellular connections can be flakey (or nonexistent). So to guarantee functionality anywhere, we built the app to assume that you have no connection to the Internet. 

    * Since the app works offline, we added functionality to sync back up with your Salesforce data once you’re back online, and even handle conflicts in the updates when you’re back online.

  4. Information capture: Get the job done on-site, even without cell phone connection.

    * Because Field Service Lightning is built offline first, mobile employees can capture signatures, product barcodes, or register new opportunities no matter where the job takes them. 

    * They can instantly access information, and even make updates offline.

    * As soon as their phone connects with a signal, the data is instantly uploaded to the Salesforce platform.

# Welcome to the Age of Self-Service 

  1. In fact, according to Harvard Business Review, 81% of customers would rather try to take care of their issue themselves before reaching out to a representative.

    *  That’s why it’s more important than ever for companies to offer not only a self-service solution for their customers, but a single place they can go to ask questions of other users, access their account and request support.

# Create a Whole New Customer Experience with Communities 

  1. With that in mind, a self-service solution should be much more than a place where customers try to troubleshoot problems on their own. It should be more useful than a beefed-up FAQ page. It should and can be:

    * A gathering place for your customers to help themselves and act as subject matter experts to help one another.

    * An account portal where customers can instantly access information they need.

    * A support hub to engage with agents, ask questions, and get guided help.

# Integrate Service Cloud and Communities on One Platform with Salesforce 

  1. The big benefit of building your customer portal on the Salesforce platform is, of course, that you’ll have everything on the powerful Salesforce platform.

    * That means that it’s fast and easy to seamlessly integrate the Salesforce features you need directly into your portal, including Service Cloud. 

  2. There are tons of useful features Service Cloud brings to your customer community. Let’s take a look at a few of them.

    * Create a One-Stop Customer Experience: You can integrate business processes, including account balances and preferences, from Salesforce or other third-party systems so customers can find what they need without leaving the community.

    * Give Customers Access to More Knowledge: It takes just a few clicks in the Lightning Community Builder to take previously internal how-to guides and articles and push them to your customer community. Now, customers have access to all your support resources at their fingertips.

    * Provide Support the Way Customers Want It: Whether it’s posing a question in a community forum, starting a live chat, or formally logging a case with support, Service Cloud offers a full suite of service options that you can make available through your customer community.

      - Bonus Tip: All service cases filed in the community will show up in Salesforce, so you can easily to track them and collect reports.

    * Deliver Smarter FAQs: Rather than generic FAQs, Service Cloud makes it possible to surface the right article the first time. How? Salesforce Einstein uses the customer’s activity on the community to determine the most relevant discussions and articles to show them.
