# Meet the Lightning App Builder

  1. The Lightning App Builder is a point-and-click tool that makes it easy to create custom pages for the Salesforce mobile app and Lightning Experience, giving your users what they need all in one place.

  2. You can update the app’s branding, navigation, options, and manage the Lightning pages assigned to that app all in the Lightning App Builder.

# How the Lightning App Builder Works and waht you can build with it

  1. Single-page apps that drill down into standard pages

  2. Dashboard-style apps, such as apps to track top sales prospects or key leads for the quarter

  3. “Point” apps to solve a particular task, such as an expense app for users to enter expenses and monitor expenses they’ve submitted

  4. Custom record pages for your objects, tailored to the needs of your users

  5. Custom Home pages containing the components and features that your users use most  

  6. A Lightning page is a custom layout that lets you design pages for use in the Salesforce mobile app or Lightning Experience. A Lightning page is composed of regions that contain components.

# Lightning Page Types

  1. App Page

    * Use an app page to create a home page for a third-party app that you can add directly into the Salesforce mobile app and Lightning Experience navigation menus. 

    * Your users then have an app home page where they can quickly access the most important objects and items.

  2. Home Page

    * Create Home pages with features relevant to specific types of users, and assign the customized pages to different apps or app-and-user-profile combinations. 
    
    * Custom Home pages are supported in Lightning Experience only.

  3. Record Page

    * With a record page, you can create a customized version of an object’s record page, tailoring it to your users’ needs.
