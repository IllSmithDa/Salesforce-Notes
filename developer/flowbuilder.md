# Flow Builder 

  1. Lightning Flow - the product that encompasses building, managing, and running flows and processes.

  2. Flow Builder - A point and click tool for building flows.

  3. Flow - an application that automates a business process by collecting data and doing something in your Salesforce org

  4. In short, the Lightning Flow product includes a couple of tools. One of them, Flow Builder, lets you create flows. 

  5. Display data to your users or collect information from them with Screen elements. You can add simple fields to your screens, like input fields and radio buttons as well as out-of-the-box Lightning components like File Upload.

  6. Logic - Control the flow of... well, your flow. Create branches, update data, loop over sets of data, or wait for a particular time.

  7. Actions - Do something in Salesforce when you have the necessary information (perhaps collected from the user via a screen). Flows can look up, create, update, and delete Salesforce records. They can also create Chatter posts, submit records for approval, and send emails. If your action isnâ€™t possible out of the box, call Apex code from the flow.

  8. Integrations - Connect your flow to an external database by using core actions or Apex actions. Core actions let you make requests without going through the Salesforce server. Flow Builder also has a couple of tie-ins to platform events. Publish platform event messages with a Create Records element. Subscribe to platform events with a Pause element.
