# Understand the AppExchange Product Lifecycle

  1. What Is an App?

    * Apps solve business problems.

    * As an AppExchange partner, think of an app as a customization of the Salesforce platform that you can distribute to others.

      - Custom fields on standard objects

      - Page layouts

      - List views
      
      - Workflows

      - Visualforce pages

      - Apex code

  2. What Is a Lightning Component?

    * Lightning components are building blocks for apps. 
    
    * They’re self-contained and reusable, and they let Salesforce customers design solutions to business problems with an intuitive, drag-and-drop interface called the Lightning App Builder.

  3. What Is a Bolt Solution?

    * Lightning Bolt Solutions are Community solution templates that help customers get up and running faster and with far less investment than was required before.

    * Best of all, seamless integration requires minimal ongoing maintenance, and makes data readily available on any device without IT involvement.

    * As a data provider, you can deliver your information without having to build you own custom data matching, appending, and enrichment service.  

    * You can simply use the built-in features of the platform. 

    * Of course, if you want to provide additional functionality, you can do that too with the same tools and technologies that all app partners can use

  5. What Is the AppExchange?

    * The AppExchange is how Salesforce customers discover amazing apps, Lightning components, and other solutions such as the ones you can build.

# Stages of the AppExchange Product Lifecycle

  1. Stage 1: Plan

    * Planning is the most important stage in the AppExchange product lifecycle. Along these lines, a successful AppExchange partnership starts with a solid plan

    * Questions to Ask

      - Who comprises your target audience? Are you going after large enterprise customers? Mid-size? Small?

      - What is your business strategy? When and how much must you sell to have a successful business?

      - Which Salesforce editions will you support? For example, Professional, Enterprise, or Unlimited.

      - Which license type do you want to use? We offer CRM, Platform, and Communities.

      - Is your staff familiar with the Salesforce platform? If not, get them up to speed using resources like Trailhead.

      - What is your strategy for ensuring that your offering is secure?

    * Tools and Resources

      - Trailhead, the fun way to learn Salesforce

      - The Partner Community, your go-to source for information about the AppExchange Partner Program

      - The ISVforce Guide, an in-depth user guide focused on AppExchange partner tools and technology

  2. Stage 2: Build

    * In this stage, you create your solution using clicks or code.

    * Then, when it’s built, you test it to make sure that it provides a great customer experience. 

    * Start by setting up development and test environments customized especially for AppExchange partners.

    * The development environment is where you implement your design, while the test environment is where you verify that everything works as planned.

    * Tools and Resources

      - Environment Hub, a tool that lets you create and manage development, testing, and packaging environments from one convenient location

      - Salesforce DX, a collection of tools that provide you with an integrated end-to-end environment designed for high-performance Agile development

  3. Stage 3: Distribute

    * It's time to release your solution to customers. Start by packaging your functionality and uploading it to the AppExchange. Next, you create an AppExchange listing so that your offering can go through final review. 

    * We support you by conducting a comprehensive security review of your solution.
    
    * Tools and Resources

      - Publishing Console, a tool for creating and managing AppExchange listings and viewing analytics for published solutions

      - AppExchange Listing, a place with resources for creating an enticing AppExchange listing

  4. Stage 4: Market
  
    * In this stage, you generate customer interest in your solution. Reach out to your target audience, leverage marketing opportunities at partner events, and optimize your AppExchange listing so that it excites customers.

    * We support you with training from our Partner Marketing team, which draws from industry best practices and lessons learned by top AppExchange partners.

    * Tools and Resources

      - Trialforce, a tool for creating immersive trial experiences for prospective customers

      - License Management App, a tool for tracking leads and managing licenses for your offering

      - Partner Marketing Power Hour, where experts and thought leaders share insights into marketing strategy

  5. Stage 5: Sell

    * The goal here is to convert leads to paying customers. You want to build an effective sales team, qualify leads efficiently, and present compelling demos to prospects.

    * After your solution gets footing in the market, you can grow your pipelines and manage renewals. 

    * We support you with training from Partner Account Managers, our direct sales teams, and top AppExchange partners.

    * Tools and Resources

      - Channel Order App, a tool that makes it easy to register sales with the AppExchange Partner Program

      - Checkout Management App, a tool that puts subscriber insights at your fingertips and lets you communicate effortlessly with customers and team members

  6. Stage 6: Support

    * Facilitate ongoing customer success with your solution. Create and implement a customer success plan, provide support and troubleshooting assistance, and make improvements to your solution through patches and upgrades. 

    *  While you support customers, we support you. We have tools that tell you how customers use your solutions and that allow you to provide hands-on help as people encounter challenges.

    * Tools and Resources

      - Push Upgrades, a feature that lets you push patches and major upgrades to existing customers

      - Subscriber Support Console, a tool that, with customer approval, lets you log in to orgs where your solution is installed to help troubleshoot issues

# Salesforce Orgs and the AppExchange Product lifecycle

  1. Production

    * Put your critical apps and data. f you’re new to the AppExchange Partner Program, we supply you with a special type of production org called a Partner Business Org. The Partner Business Org has AppExchange partner tools pre-installed, along with two Sales Cloud licenses. 

  2. Developer 

    * Build your solution. A developer org allows you to experiment without putting critical data at risk and is separate from production. As an AppExchange partner, you can create Partner Developer Edition orgs that have more licenses and storage than the standard Developer Edition. If you're using Salesforce DX, you can also use scratch org for development. 

  3. Packaging 

    * Package your solution for distribution. We recommend using a Partner Developer Edition org for packaging, but a Developer Edition org works, too. 

  4. Test 

    * Show off your solution to prospective customers. A demo org is based on a standard Salesforce environment, but has more user licenses and storage. These special features let you set up an org just like a customer does, which allows your sales team to deliver powerful demonstrations. You can create demos based on Group, Professional, and Enterprise Edition orgs. 

  5. Trial 

    * Let customers experience your solution firsthand. You can let customers interact with your solution in their own trial Salesforce org or one you’ve set up. Along with your app or Lightning component, you can customize a trial org with users and sample data. 

  6. Sandbox 

    * Test functionality created by others. A sandbox is a copy of a production org. It provides a realistic environment where customers can test things, like a new AppExchange solution, without putting their company’s critical apps and data at risk. As an AppExchange partner, use a developer org to build your solution, not a sandbox. 

# Partner Business Orgs and Partner Developer Edition Orgs

    * Managing leads and licenses with the License Management App (LMA)

    * Submitting orders with the Channel Order App (COA)
